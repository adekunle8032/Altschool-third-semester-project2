Usage
Authentication and Authorization
This API is secured using JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization. To access protected endpoints, you will need to provide an access token in the request headers.

To obtain an access token, send a POST request to the /auth/login endpoint with valid user credentials in the request body. The response will contain an access token which can be used to access protected endpoints.
